POW EDUCATION

---

A lot of things are changing in our current world

Not only that, the pace at which change is happening is faster than ever before

Fuelled by technology and outdated institutions failing to deliver value, we are presented with opportunities to create valuable solutions

Solutions that pioneer a new age for humanity. One of those opportunities is education


Specifically, this piece will focus on higher education and use examples within the context of health

Our current institutions are what I call "proof of degree"

You apply for a program of study, spend many years and lots of money learning mostly outdated information in order to obtain a degree

By obtaining said degree, you are assured that you now "know the thing" and that people will perceive the degree as a valid proxy of ability

What if your degree doesn't teach you useful information? What if the degree carries zero validity as a proxy of ability?

What if the people we consider to be the "knowers" actually don't know anything useful, and even worse, know the wrong things

As someone who spent years and lots of money obtaining a degree in what I formally considered a "health profession", I was confronted with a harsh reality

I was told I was learning health but I learned nothing about health. I learned about disease

Specifically, I learned how to diagnose disease and how to treat symptoms

In a disease centric world where we don't teach health, almost everyone becomes diseased. This is where we now find ourselves


Proof of degree education is dying. Universities aren't delivering value. Professors are telling student what to know and how to think

Opportunity: a return to natural learning where students are taught fundamentals, encouraged to explore and think for themselves

Enter POW education


Proof of work education is fundamentally different than proof of degree education

Instead of using a piece of paper to show you know something, your work and the results you have achieved are shared and serve as proof of your education

Proof of work education generates proof of ability

Instead of being tested by a professor, your work is witnessed by your peers who challenge you, offer feedback and reflect on your work


Within the realm of health, proof of work education looks something like this:

In order to be vetted as a health authority, you must prove you have done the work to acquire useful knowledge that yields positive results

How does one prove that? By demonstrating proof of work - your own health and the steps you took to get to where you are

Instead of relying on letters beside your name to show you know what you're talking about, your own health is your proof


I've lived most of my life within the legacy proof of degree system

I've witnessed unhealthy "knowers" guide people seeking help down the wrong path

Don't get me wrong, these "knowers" have the best intentions in mind

They are doing exactly what they have been trained to do and simply don't understand the harm they are causing
